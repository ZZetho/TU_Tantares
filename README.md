# Credits:
- The specular textures included in this mod are derivatives of the excellent original textures of [Tantares](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/73686-112x-tantares-stockalike-soyuz-and-mir-16128052024mars-expedition-wip/) created by [Beale](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/profile/70533-beale/), who was kind kind enough to release their mod under a CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

# Known issues:
- The level of detail of all of the parts is a bit low (ie: little contrast between dark / light areas), workaround: turn up the detail level in the recolour GUI.
- The dish of the Aquila radar cannot be recoloured for technical reasons.
- Some of the recolour areas are a bit odd as to what section they are (red / green / blue), this is also becasue of techincal reasons.
